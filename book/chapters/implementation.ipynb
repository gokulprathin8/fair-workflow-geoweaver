    "The first phase of the SWE Prediction Workflow involves data integration and pre-processing. Pygeoweaver streamlines this critical step by enabling researchers to ingest data from diverse sources, including SRTM DEM and AMSR data. The integrated data undergoes essential pre-processing to ensure consistency and accuracy. Pygeoweaver's capabilities in data handling and transformation play a pivotal role in this phase, ensuring that the workflow starts with clean and well-prepared data."
